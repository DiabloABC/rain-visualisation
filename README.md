# Rain Visualisation
After wanting to make random programs, I finally decided to work on a simple program that visualises rain (as the name suggests).

## Languages Used
* HTML as a platform to display the program
* JavaScript for the actual code of the program. Specifically, I used p5.js, which is a JavaScript library that is used for graphic programs.

## Reference Video
For the code, I followed <i>The Coding Train</i>'s YouTube video as a reference. Since he used <i>Processing</i> in the video, I made some small changes to make it work in JavaScript.
